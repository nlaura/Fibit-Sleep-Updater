# Fibit Sleep Updater
**Fitbit Sleep Updater is a simple bookmarklet for the Fitbit online webpage to fix their small bug.**

*When using my Fitbit Charge HR tracker I discovered it doesn't automatically give the right "time to fall asleep" value on their webpage. So I read from their Help forum that this is their wellknown problem and a simple way to fix this is to just edit the time I left bed manually by one minute(add or substract). After a few days I got tired from doing so much work to just fix a simple thing daily, therefore I decided to write a simple Bookmarklet to fix this.*

### What the Bookmarklet does
It substracts or adds a minute to the time you left bed and saves it automatically without you having to click or do anything.

###How to install

Just go to this page: [CLICK HERE](https://nlaura.github.io/Fibit-Sleep-Updater/).

###How to use
1. Log in to fitbit.com

2. Go to "Log" and choose "Sleep" (now you should be able to see detailed information about your last night sleep)

3. Click on the bookmarklet on the bookmark toolbar

4. Done! :)
